The big data phenomenon is fueled by cheap sensors and high-throughput simulation models, the increasing volume and detail of information captured by enterprises, the rise of multimedia, social media, and the Internet. It exists from social media to cell biology offering unparalleled opportunities to document the inner workings of many complex systems [1]. Research by MGI and McKinsey's Business Technology Office argues that there will be a shortage of talent necessary for organizations to take advantage of big data. \"By 2018, the United States alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions\" [2]. In everyday life, people deal with large amounts of data regularly: online search engines provide access to millions of web sites almost instantly; consumer sites offer literally thousands of purchase options seamlessly; and social media sites let you create and benefit from extensive social networks. In bestselling books like Freakonomics, Super Crunchers and The Numerati, authors illuminate how more and more decisions in health care, politics, education, and other sectors utilize big data and data analysis [3]. The texts highlight the growing need for specialists and every-day citizens to be able to understand and interpret data. Whether it is a table of nutritional information, a graph of stock prices, or a chart comparing health care plans, the skills of understanding and interpreting data are necessary to navigate successfully through daily life. This talk starts with a review of visual analytics projects that aim to increase our understanding of how people learn, increase the efficacy of learning environments, or support decision making in education [4]. The second part of the talk provides a theoretical framework for the design of effective data analysis workflows and insightful visualizations. It also introduces plug-and-play macroscope tools [5], see also http://cishell.org, that were designed for different research communities and are used by more than 120,000 users from 40+ countries to design and benefit from visualizations of complex data.

While these models explain how individuals learn in varying social dimensions, very few studies provide empirical validation of such models and extend them to include group learning and performance. In this exploratory study, we develop a theoretical model based on social learning and social network theories to understand how knowledge professionals engage in learning and performance, both as individuals and as groups. We investigate the association between egocentric network properties (structure, position and tie), 'content richness' in the social learning process and performance. Analysis from data collected using an online eLearning environment shows that rather than performance; social learning is influenced by properties of social network structure (density, inter-group and intra-network communication), relations (tie strength) and position (efficiency). Furthermore, individuals who communicate with others internal rather than external to the group show higher tendencies of social learning. The contribution of this study is therefore two-fold: a theoretical development of a social learning and networks based model for understanding learning and performance; and the construction of a novel metric called 'content richness' as a surrogate measure for social learning. In conclusion, a useful implication of the study is that the model fosters understanding social factors that influence learning and performance in the domain of learning analytics. It also begs the question of whether the relationship between social networks and performance is mediated or moderated by learning and whether assumptions of the model hold true in non-educational domains.", "authors": ["Walter Christian Paredes", "Kon Shing Kenneth Chung"]}, {"title": "Multi-mediated community structure in a socio-technical network", "pages": "43-53", "doi": "10.1145/2330601.2330618", "abstract": "Digital environments for networked learning and professional networks may not comprise one \"community:\" identification of clusters of affiliated groups of participants that potentially constitute embedded communities is an empirical matter, and one of interest to managers of large learning and professional networks.

We have developed an analytic framework for extracting events from log files and representing interaction and affiliations at different granularities as needed for analysis. In this paper we show how bimodal networks of actors and media artifacts can be constructed in which directed arcs relate actors to the artifacts they read, write or edit, and how the resulting graphs can be used to detect community structures that extend across different media.

Informal learning is an important driver for professional development and workplace learning. However powerful informal learning may be, there is a problem when it comes to making it a real asset within organizations: Informal learning activities are mostly invisible to others, sometimes the learners themselves might not even be aware of the learning that occurs. As a consequence informal learning in organizations goes undetected, remains off the radar of HR departments and is therefore hard to asses, manage and value [1]. This problem poses an interesting challenge for the field of Learning Analytics, namely finding ways to capture and analyse traces of (social) informal learning in every day life and work networks. Therefore empirical research and tools are needed that can raise awareness about informal learning activities to make it surface the radar, amplify the benefits of it and strengthen the social relations through which it occurs. In this paper we introduce a tool that aims to facilitate exactly this and we hope to stimulate to widen the discussion on Learning Analytics by expanding the field from a predominantly educational focus to informal and workplace learning.

Students are not the only actors in their learning journeys and it would seem crucial that learning analytics also includes the impacts of all stakeholders on students' learning journeys in order to increase the success of students' learning.

S3 synthesizes several strands of risk analytics: the use of predictive models to identify academically at-risk students, the creation of data visualizations for reaching diagnostic insights, and the application of a case-based approach for managing interventions. Such a system poses numerous design, implementation, and research challenges. In this paper we discuss a core research challenge for designing early warning systems such as S3. We then propose our approach for meeting that challenge. A practical implementation of an student risk early warning system, utilizing predictive models, must meet two design criteria: a) the methodology for generating predictive models must be flexible to allow generalization from one context to another; b) the underlying mechanism of prediction should be easily interpretable by practitioners whose end goal is to design meaningful interventions on behalf of students. Our proposed solution applies an ensemble method for predictive modeling using a strategy of decomposition. Decomposition provides a flexible technique for generating and generalizing predictive models across different contexts. Decomposition into interpretable semantic units, when coupled with data visualizations and case management tools, allows practitioners, such as instructors and advisors, to build a bridge between prediction and intervention.", "authors": ["Alfred Essa", "Hanan Ayad"]}, {"title": "GLASS: a learning analytics visualization tool", "pages": "162-163", "doi": "10.1145/2330601.2330642", "abstract": "The use of technology in every day tasks enables the possibility to collect large amounts of observations of events taking place in different environments. Most tools are capable of storing a detailed account of the operations executed by users in certain files commonly known as logs. These files can be further analyzed to infer information that is not directly visible such as the most popular applications, times of the day with highest activity, calories burnt after a running session, etc. Graphic visualizations of this data can be used to support this type of analysis as shown in [1]. Visualization can also be applied in the domain of learning experiences to track and analyse the data obtained from both learners and instructors. There are several tools that have been proposed in specific environments such as, for example, in personal learning environments [5], to foster self-reflection and awareness [2], and to support instructors in web-based distance learning [3]. These visualizations need to take into account aspects such as how to access and protect personal data, filter management, multi-user support and availability. In this paper, the web-based visualization platform GLASS (Gradient's Learning Analytics System) is presented. The architecture of the tool has been conceived to support a large number of modular visualizations derived from a common dataset containing a large number of recorded events. The tool was developed following a bottom-up methodology to provide a set of basic operations required by any visualization. The design goal is to provide a highly versatile, modular platform that simplifies the implementation of new visualizations. The main functionality elements considered in GLASS are database access, module management, visualization parameters, and the web interface. The platform uses datasets stored using the CAM schema (Contextualized Attention Metadata) [6]. This schema allows to capture events occurring during the use of various computer applications which, in our case, are the tools used by students when working in a learning environment. The process to obtain events from learning environments has been described in [4]. GLASS is able to connect to more than one CAM database, thus allowing access to events obtained in different contexts. The tool is extensible through the installation of modules. A module is a structured set of scripts and resources that, given a dataset of events and a set of filters, generates at least one visualization. In order to simplify the development of new modules, the platform provides an API to manage common visualizations settings such as the date range and other typical filters. A visualization may include a simpler version suitable to be displayed in the user's Dashboard, which is the entry page of the application. Figure 1 shows an example of dashboard in GLASS. Additionally, visualizations can be exported as HTML code to be embedded in another website. The GLASS architecture consists of four layers: data layer, code base, modules and visualizations, as depicted in Figure 2. The data layer is composed of a set of CAM databases and a database to store the platform parameters. The code base is in charge of the main functionalities of GLASS regarding module and user management and interfaces. Modules must comply with the platform specifications to generate visualizations and the settings that can affect their appearance. Currently, the tool includes a default module that provides two visualizations as shown in Figure 1): a frequency time line of activity events and a bar-chart with grouped bars of events generated by different user groups (e.g. events from students individually, or groups). The default module also serves as an example of how to develop a additional modules. Currently, GLASS is able to support new visualizations and is undergoing additional testing in different learning scenarios. Preliminary results obtained from user tests indicate that visualizations need to be very intuitive for both instructors and learners. The current development effort is focused on providing visualizations that show the most-common learners events and the most active learners in a given context. To encourage its use in other institutions, the tool has been released with an open source license and can be obtained from http://glass.mozart.gast.it.uc3m.es.

However, unlike face-to-face classes, teachers have difficulty in monitoring their learners in an online environment, since a lot of learning management systems provide faculty with student tracking data in a poor tabular format that is difficult to understand. In order to overcome this drawback, this paper presents a novel graphical educational monitoring tool based on faceted browsing that helps instructors to gain an insight into their classrooms' performance.

A key challenge when designing simulated learning environments is how to align the experience in the simulated world with real world experiences. Social media resources provide user-generated content that is rich in digital traces of real world experiences. People comments, tweets, and blog posts in social spaces can reveal interesting aspects of real world situations or can show what particular group of users is interested in or aware of. This paper examines a systematic way to analyze user-generated content in social media resources to provide useful information for learning simulator design. A hybrid framework exploiting Machine Learning and Semantics for social group profiling is presented. The framework has five stages: (1) Retrieval of user-generated content from the social resource (2) Content noise filtration, removing spam, abuse, and content irrelevant to the learning domain; (3) Deriving individual social profiles for the content authors; (4) Clustering of individuals into groups of similar authors; and (5) Deriving group profiles, where interesting concepts suitable for the use in simulated learning systems are extracted from the aggregated content authored by each group. The framework is applied to derive group profiles by mining user comments on YouTube videos. The application is evaluated in an experimental study within the context of learning interpersonal skills in job interviews. The paper discusses how the YouTube-based group profiles can be used to facilitate the design of a job interview skills learning simulator, considering: (1) identifying learning needs based on digital traces of real world experiences; and (2) augmenting learner models in simulators based on group characteristics derived from social media.", "authors": ["Ahmad Ammari", "Lydia Lau", "Vania Dimitrova"]}, {"title": "The learning registry: building a foundation for learning resource analytics", "pages": "208-211", "doi": "10.1145/2330601.2330651", "abstract": "We describe our experimentation with the current implementation of a distribution system used to share descriptive and social metadata about learning resources.

The paper presents a case study where the analysis method was evaluated by analyzing co-blogging data from a reading and writing intensive undergraduate course. The evidence shows that the tool can be predictive of students' writing in a manner that correlates with their progress in the course and engagement in the technology-mediated activity.

Analysis suggested that more complex functions did not fit the data significantly better than a linear function. In addition, there was not evidence that the length of a specific pause matters for predicting learning outcomes; e.g. students who make many short pauses do not appear to learn more or less than students who make a smaller number of long pauses.
