Formative assessment by constant monitoring of the intellectual achievement of real-world learners is essential for adaptive learning support, but no assessment methodology has yet been developed. We consider a method to systematically integrate heterogeneous factors of real-world learning: learners' internal situations, their external situations, and their learning field. Then, we propose a method for formatively assessing the situation of real-world learning. The method enables us to recognize the sequence of characteristic stay behavior and the associated body posture of a learner, and to estimate the 3D location of his/her interest. The method enables the estimation of not only the learning topic that a learner is currently examining in a field but also the prospective topics that he/she should learn. Our assessment method is the basis for context-aware support to promote the emergence of new knowledge from intellectual collaboration in the world.", "authors": ["Masaya Okada", "Masahiro Tada"]}, {"title": "Clustering for improving educational process mining", "pages": "11-15", "doi": "10.1145/2567574.2567604", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose to use clustering to improve educational process mining.

Using the k-means clustering algorithm, we find four types of visual classroom environments (one of them an outlier within our data set), representing teachers' strategies in classroom decoration.

Four principles of pedagogical learning analytics intervention design that can be used by teachers and course developers to support the productive use of learning analytics by students are introduced: Integration, Agency, Reference Frame and Dialogue. In addition three core processes in which to engage students are described: Grounding, Goal-Setting and Reflection. These principles and processes are united in a preliminary model of pedagogical learning analytics intervention design for students, presented as a starting point for further inquiry.", "authors": ["Alyssa Friend Wise"]}, {"title": "A cognitive processing framework for learning analytics", "pages": "212-216", "doi": "10.1145/2567574.2567610", "abstract": "Incorporating a learner's level of cognitive processing into Learning Analytics presents opportunities for obtaining rich data on the learning process. We propose a framework called COPA that provides a basis for mapping levels of cognitive operation into a learning analytics system. We utilise Bloom's taxonomy, a theoretically respected conceptualisation of cognitive processing, and apply it in a flexible structure that can be implemented incrementally and with varying degree of complexity within an educational organisation. We outline how the framework is applied, and its key benefits and limitations. Finally, we apply COPA to a University undergraduate unit, and demonstrate its utility in identifying key missing elements in the structure of the course.", "authors": ["Andrew Gibson", "Kirsty Kitto", "Jill Willis"]}, {"title": "Statistical discourse analysis of online discussions: informal cognition, social metacognition and knowledge creation", "pages": "217-225", "doi": "10.1145/2567574.2567580", "abstract": "To statistically model large data sets of knowledge processes during asynchronous, online forums, we must address analytic difficulties involving the whole data set (missing data, nested data and the tree structure of online messages), dependent variables (multiple, infrequent, discrete outcomes and similar adjacent messages), and explanatory variables (sequences, indirect effects, false positives, and robustness). Statistical discourse analysis (SDA) addresses all of these issues, as shown in an analysis of 1,330 asynchronous messages written and self-coded by 17 students during a 13-week online educational technology course. The results showed how attributes at multiple levels (individual and message) affected knowledge creation processes. Men were more likely than women to theorize. Asynchronous messages created a micro-sequence context; opinions and asking about purpose preceded new information; anecdotes, opinions, different opinions, elaborating ideas, and asking about purpose or information preceded theorizing. These results show how informal thinking precedes formal thinking and how social metacognition affects knowledge creation.", "authors": ["Ming Ming Chiu", "Nobuko Fujita"]}, {"title": "Uncovering what matters: analyzing transitional relations among contribution types in knowledge-building discourse", "pages": "226-230", "doi": "10.1145/2567574.2567606", "abstract": "Temporality matters for analysis of collaborative learning. The present study attempts to uncover temporal patterns that distinguish \"productive\" threads of knowledge building inquiry. Using a rich knowledge building discourse dataset, in which notes' contribution types and threads' productivity have been coded, a secondary temporal analysis was conducted. In particular, Lag-sequential Analysis was conducted to identify transitional patterns among different contribution types that distinguish productive threads from \"improvable\" ones. Results indicated that productive inquiry threads involved significantly more transitions among questioning, theorizing, obtaining information, and working with information; in contrast, responding to questions and theories by merely giving opinions was not sufficient to achieve knowledge progress.

The emerging field of learning analytics is at the intersection of numerous academic disciplines, and therefore draws on a diversity of methodologies, theories and underpinning scientific assumptions. Through citation analysis and structured mapping we aimed to identify the emergence of trends and disciplinary hierarchies that are influencing the development of the field to date. The results suggest that there is some fragmentation in the major disciplines (computer science and education) regarding conference and journal representation. The analyses also indicate that the commonly cited papers are of a more conceptual nature than empirical research reflecting the need for authors to define the learning analytics space. An evaluation of the current state of learning analytics provides numerous benefits for the development of the field, such as a guide for under-represented areas of research and to identify the disciplines that may require more strategic and targeted support and funding opportunities.", "authors": ["Shane Dawson", "Dragan Ga\u0161evi\u0107", "George Siemens", "Srecko Joksimovic"]}, {"title": "Teaching the unteachable: on the compatibility of learning analytics and humane education", "pages": "241-245", "doi": "10.1145/2567574.2567607", "abstract": "This paper is an exploratory effort to find a place for learning analytics in humane education. After distinguishing humane education from training on the basis of the Aristotelian model of intellectual capabilities, and arguing that humane education is distinct by virtue of its interest in cultivating prudence, which is unteachable, an account of three key characteristics of humane education is provided. Appealing to thinkers of the Italian Renaissance, it is argued that ingenium, eloquence, and self-knowledge constitute the what, how, and why of humane education. Lastly, looking to several examples from recent learning analytics literature, it is demonstrated that learning analytics is not only helpful as set of aids for ensuring success in scientific and technical disciplines, but in the humanities as well. In order to function effectively as an aid to humane education, however, learning analytics must be embedded within a context that encourages continuous reflection, responsiveness, and personal responsibility for learning.", "authors": ["Timothy D.

This includes the different groups of people involved -- learners, educators, administrators and support staff -- the practices of those groups, their understandings of how teaching and learning take place, the technologies they use and the specific environments within which they operate. Each element of the TEL Complex requires explicit and careful consideration during the process of implementation, in order to avoid failure and maximise the chances of success.
