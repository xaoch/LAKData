Students' reflection journals also offer a rich source of data for formative assessment. However, the analysis of the textual reflections in class of large size presents challenges. Automatic analysis of students' reflective writing holds great promise for providing adaptive real time support for students. This paper proposes a method based on topic modeling techniques for the task of themes exploration and reflection grade prediction. We evaluated this method on a sample of journal writings from pre-service teachers. The topic modeling method was able to discover the important themes and patterns emerged in students' reflection journals. Weekly topic relevance and word count were identified as important indicators of their journal grades. Based on the patterns discovered by topic modeling, prediction models were developed to automate the assessing and grading of reflection journals. The findings indicate the potential of topic modeling in serving as an analytic tool for teachers to explore and assess students' reflective thoughts in written journals.", "authors": ["Ye Chen", "Bei Yu", "Xuewei Zhang", "Yihan Yu"], "session": "SESSION: Discourse analytics"}, {"title": "Combining click-stream data with NLP tools to better understand MOOC completion", "pages": "6-14", "doi": "10.1145/2883851.2883931", "abstract": "Completion rates for massive open online classes (MOOCs) are notoriously low. Identifying student patterns related to course completion may help to develop interventions that can improve retention and learning outcomes in MOOCs. Previous research predicting MOOC completion has focused on click-stream data, student demographics, and natural language processing (NLP) analyses. However, most of these analyses have not taken full advantage of the multiple types of data available. This study combines click-stream data and NLP approaches to examine if students' on-line activity and the language they produce in the online discussion forum is predictive of successful class completion. We study this analysis in the context of a subsample of 320 students who completed at least one graded assignment and produced at least 50 words in discussion forums, in a MOOC on educational data mining. The findings indicate that a mix of click-stream data and NLP indices can predict with substantial accuracy (78%) whether students complete the MOOC. This predictive power suggests that student interaction data and language data within a MOOC can help us both to understand student retention in MOOCs and to develop automated signals of student success.", "authors": ["Scott Crossley", "Luc Paquette", "Mihai Dascalu", "Danielle S.

Using Coh-Metrix and LIWC features, together with a set of custom features developed to capture discussion context, we developed a random forest classification system that achieved 70.3% classification accuracy and 0.63 Cohen's kappa, which is significantly higher than values reported in the previous studies. Besides improvement in classification accuracy, the developed system is also less sensitive to overfitting as it uses only 205 classification features, which is around 100 times less features than in similar systems based on bag-of-words features.

This study takes an initial step toward addressing this gap by building a predictive model of students' affect using information that can potentially be collected by computer systems. We used individual difference measures, text indices, and keystroke analyses to predict engagement and boredom in 132 writing sessions. The results suggest that these three categories of indices were successful in modeling students' affective states during writing.

This paper reports progress in designing a writing analytics application, detailing the methodology by which informally expressed rubrics are modelled as formal rhetorical patterns, a capability delivered by a novel web application. This has been through iterative evaluation on an independently human-annotated corpus, showing improvements from the first to second version.

We find that over all eight weekly sessions, the social networks constructed from the forum interactions are relatively sparse and lack the tendency for preferential attachment. By analyzing data from the second week, we also find that individuals with higher performance scores from current, previous, and future weeks tend to be more connected in the social network.

Learning analytics should have a stronger focus on improving the quality of learning for all students, not only identifying at risk students. In order to do so, we need to understand what successful patterns look like when reflected in data and subsequently adjust the course design to avoid unsuccessful patterns and facilitate successful patterns. However, when establishing these successful patterns, it is important to account for individual differences among students since previous research has shown that not all students engage with learning resources to the same extent. Regulation strategies seem to play an important role in explaining the different usage patterns students' display when using digital learning recourses. When learning analytics research incorporates contextualized data about student regulation strategies we are able to differentiate between students at a more granular level. The current study examined if regulation strategies could account for differences in the use of various learning resources. It examines how students regulated their learning process and subsequently used the different learning resources throughout the course and established how this use contributes to course performance. The results show that students with different regulation strategies use the learning resources to the same extent. However, the use of learning resources influences course performance differently for different groups of students. This paper recognizes the importance of contextualization of learning data resources with a broader set of indicators to understand the learning process.

This paper proposes a new algorithm for sequencing questions to students that is empirically shown to lead to better performance and engagement in real schools when compared to a baseline approach. It is based on using knowledge tracing to model students' skill acquisition over time, and to select questions that advance the student's learning within the range of the student's capabilities, as determined by the model. The algorithm is based on a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model that incorporates partial credit scores, reasoning about multiple attempts to solve problems, and integrating item difficulty. This model is shown to outperform other BKT models that do not reason about (or reason about some but not all) of these features. The model was incorporated into a sequencing algorithm and deployed in two classes in different schools where it was compared to a baseline sequencing algorithm that was designed by pedagogical experts. In both classes, students using the BKT sequencing approach solved more difficult questions and attributed higher performance than did students who used the expert-based approach. Students were also more engaged using the BKT approach, as determined by their interaction time and number of log-ins to the system, as well as their reported opinion.

But such experiments are expensive, and any single experiment in a particular course context does not provide rigorous evidence that the causal link will generalize to other course content. We suggest that analytics of increasingly available online learning data sets can complement experimental efforts by facilitating more widespread evaluation of the generalizability of claims about what learning methods produce better student learning outcomes. We illustrate with analytics that narrow in on a causal interpretation of the doer effect by showing that doing within a course unit predicts learning of that unit content more than doing in units before or after.

SRL has been the focus of research in traditional classroom learning and is also argued to play a vital role in the online or blended learning contexts. In this paper, we study how SRL affects students' online interactions with various learning activities and its influence in academic performance. The results derived from a naturalistic experiment among a cohort of first year engineering students showed that positive self-regulated strategies (PSRS) and negative self-regulated strategies (NSRS) affected both the interaction with online activities and academic performance. NSRS directly predicted academic outcomes, whereas PSRS only contributed indirectly to academic performance via the interactions with online activities. These results point to concrete avenues to promote self-regulation among students in this type of learning contexts.", "authors": ["Abelardo Pardo", "Feifei Han", "Robert A.

When controlled randomization is present in the learning platform, such as randomized ordering of problems within a problem set, natural quasi-randomized controlled studies can be conducted, post-hoc. Difficulty and learning gain attribution are among factors of interest that can be studied with secondary analyses under these conditions. However, much of the content that we might like to evaluate for learning value is not administered as a random stimulus to students but instead is being self-selected, such as a student choosing to seek help in the discussion forums, wiki pages, or other pedagogically relevant material in online courseware. Help seekers, by virtue of their motivation to seek help, tend to be the ones who have the least knowledge. When presented with a cohort of students with a bi-modal or uniform knowledge distribution, this can present problems with model interpretability when a single point estimation is used to represent cohort prior knowledge. Since resource access is indicative of a low knowledge student, a model can tend towards attributing the resources with low or negative learning gain in order to better explain performance given the higher average prior point estimate. In this paper we present several individualized prior strategies and demonstrate how learning efficacy attribution validity and prediction accuracy improve as a result. Level of education attained, relative past assessment performance, and the prior per student cold start heuristic were employed and compared as prior knowledge individualization strategies.", "authors": ["Zachary A.

Disciplinary course type (based on Biglan's [7] typology) was significantly related to a student's likelihood to enter below average performance classifications. Students were the most likely to enter a classification in fields like the natural science, mathematics, and engineering in comparison to humanities courses. We attribute these disparities in academic performance to disciplinary norms around teaching and assessment. In particular, the timing of assessments played a major role in students' ability to exit a classification.

Simply put, the provision of learning analytics alone has not necessarily led to changing teaching practices. In order to support pedagogical change and aid interpretation, this paper proposes a model that can enable instructors to readily identify subpopulations of students to provide specific support actions.

We found that the most common reported MOOC emotion was Hope followed by Enjoyment and Contentment. There were substantial shifts in affective states over the course, notably with Anxiety and Pride. The most valuable result of our study is a preliminary description of the methods for collecting self-reported student affect at scale in a MOOC setting.", "authors": ["John Dillon", "G.

In addition to requiring real-world steps for various in-game activities, a dashboard in this game presents visual representations of activity patterns, ostensibly informing students about patterns of their own activity.

This paper summarizes the main outcomes of a systematic literature review on learning dashboards, in the fields of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining. The query was run in five main academic databases and enriched with papers coming from GScholar, resulting in 346 papers out of which 55 were included in the final analysis. Our review distinguishes different kinds of research studies as well as different aspects of learning dashboards and their maturity in terms of evaluation. As the research field is still relatively young, many of the studies are exploratory and proof-of-concept. Among the main open issues and future lines of work in the area of learning dashboards, we identify the need for longitudinal research in authentic settings, as well as studies that systematically compare different dashboard design options.", "authors": ["Beat A.

Building on a new conceptual model developed by the Open University UK (OU), we will analyse three case-studies of evidence-based interventions. By working with 90+ large-scale modules for a period of two years across the five faculties and disciplines within the OU, Analytics4Action provides a bottom-up-approach for working together with key stakeholders within their respective contexts. Using principles of embedded case-study approaches by Yin [1], by comparing the learning behavior, satisfaction and performance of 11079 learners the findings indicated that each of the three learning designs led to satisfied students and average to good student retention. In the second part we highlighted that the three module teams made in-presentation interventions based upon real-time analytics, whereby initial user data indicated VLE behaviour in line with expectations. In 2-5 years, we hope that a rich, robust evidence-base will be presented to show how learning analytics can help teachers to make informed, timely and successful interventions that will help learners to achieve their learning outcomes.", "authors": ["Bart Rienties", "Avinash Boroowa", "Simon Cross", "Lee Farrington-Flint", "Christothea Herodotou", "Lynda Prescott", "Kevin Mayles", "Tom Olney", "Lisette Toetenel", "John Woodthorpe"], "session": "POSTER SESSION: Posters"}, {"title": "Analyzing students' intentionality towards badges within a case study using Khan academy", "pages": "536-537", "doi": "10.1145/2883851.2883947", "abstract": "One of the most common gamification techniques in education is the use of badges as a reward for making specific student actions. We propose two indicators to gain insight about students' intentionality towards earning badges and use them with data from 291 students interacting with Khan Academy courses. The intentionality to earn badges was greater for repetitive badges, and this can be related to the fact that these are easier to achieve. We provide the general distribution of students depending on these badge indicators, obtaining different profiles of students which can be used for adaptation purposes.", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 A.

Adaptive educational technology Snappet combines extracted and embedded learning analytics daily in classrooms. While students make exercises on the tablet this technology displays real-time data of learner performance in a teacher dashboard (extracted analytics). At the same time, learner performance is used to adaptively adjust exercises to students' progress (embedded analytics). This quasiexperimental study compares the development of students' arithmetic skills over one schoolyear (grade 2 and 4) in a traditional paper based setting to learning with the adaptive educational technology Snappet. The results indicate that students in the Snappet condition make significantly more progress on arithmetic skills in grade 4. Moreover, in this grade students with a high ability level, benefit the most from working with this adaptive educational technology. Overall the development pattern of students with different abilities was more divergent in the AET condition compared to the control condition. These results indicate that adaptive educational technologies combining extracted and embedded learning analytics are indeed creating new education scenarios that contribute to personalized learning in primary education.", "authors": ["Inge Molenaar", "Carolien Knoop van Campen"], "session": "POSTER SESSION: Posters"}, {"title": "Elaborating data intensive research methods through researcher-practitioner partnerships", "pages": "540-541", "doi": "10.1145/2883851.2883908", "abstract": "Technologies used by teachers and students generate vast amounts of data that can be analyzed to provide insights into improving teaching and learning.
