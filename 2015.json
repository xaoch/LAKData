Whilst each of these disciplines has consolidated design methodologies, there is a need for more specific methodological frameworks within the cross-disciplinary space defined by learning analytics. In particular there is no systematic workflow for producing learning analytics tools that are both technologically feasible and truly underpin the learning experience. In this paper, we present the LATUX workflow, a five-stage workflow to design, deploy and validate awareness tools in technology-enabled learning environments. LATUX is grounded on a well-established design process for creating, testing and re-designing user interfaces. We extend this process by integrating the pedagogical requirements to generate visual analytics to inform instructors' pedagogical decisions or intervention strategies. The workflow is illustrated with a case study in which collaborative activities were deployed in a real classroom.", "authors": ["Roberto Martinez-Maldonado", "Abelardo Pardo", "Negin Mirriahi", "Kalina Yacef", "Judy Kay", "Andrew Clayphan"], "session": "SESSION: Indicators and tools for awareness"}, {"title": "Learning analytics beyond the LMS: the connected learning analytics toolkit", "pages": "11-15", "doi": "10.1145/2723576.2723627", "abstract": "We present a Connected Learning Analytics (CLA) toolkit, which enables data to be extracted from social media and imported into a Learning Record Store (LRS), as defined by the new xAPI standard.

While anecdotally this has been a commonly held belief among researchers, scientists, and educators, there is little empirical research to support this claim. This study investigates this hypothesis by examining how students vary in their use of linguistic features across 16 prompt-based essays. Forty-five high school students wrote 16 essays across 8 sessions within an Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) system. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques and Entropy analyses were used to calculate how rigid or flexible students were in their use of narrative linguistic features over time and how this trait related to individual differences in literacy ability and essay quality. Additional analyses indicated that NLP and Entropy reliably detected narrative flexibility (or rigidity) after session 2 and was related to students' prior literacy skills. These exploratory methodologies are important for researchers and educators, as they indicate that writing flexibility is indeed a trait of strong writers and can be detected rather quickly using the combination of textual features and dynamic analyses.", "authors": ["Erica L.

In order to accelerate the modeling process by eliminating the manual annotation bottleneck, a fully unsupervised machine learning approach is utilized for this task. The results indicate that these unsupervised models are significantly improved with the addition of automatically extracted posture and gesture information.

In this paper, we explore the role of multimodal analysis in the service of studying complex learning environments. We compare uni-modal and multimodal; manual and semi-automated methods for examining how students learn in a hands-on, engineering design context. Specifically, we compare human annotations, speech, gesture and electro-dermal activation data from a study (N=20) where student participating in two different experimental conditions. The experimental conditions have already been shown to be associated with differences in learning gains and design quality. Hence, one objective of this paper is to identify the behavioral practices that differed between the two experimental conditions, as this may help us better understand how the learning interventions work. An additional objective is to provide examples of how to conduct learning analytics research in complex environments and compare how the same algorithm, when used with different forms of data can provide complementary results.", "authors": ["Marcelo Worsley", "Paulo Blikstein"], "session": "SESSION: Multilevel, multimodal and network analysis"}, {"title": "From contingencies to network-level phenomena: multilevel analysis of activity and actors in heterogeneous networked learning environments", "pages": "368-377", "doi": "10.1145/2723576.2723626", "abstract": "Learning in social settings is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple processes at individual and collective levels of agency.

Ubiquitous Learning Log (ULL) is defined as a digital record of what learners have learned in the daily life using ubiquitous technologies. It allows learners to log their learning experiences with photos, audios, videos, location, RFID tag and sensor data, and to share and reuse ULL with others. By constructing real-world corpora which comprise of accumulated ULLs with information such as what, when, where, and how learners have learned in the real world and by analyzing them, we can support learners to learn more effectively. The proposed system will predict their future learning opportunities including their learning patterns and trends by analyzing their past ULLs. The prediction is made possible both by network analysis based on ULL information such as learners, knowledge, place and time and by learners' self-analysis using time-map. By predicting what they tend to learn next in their learning paths, it provides them with more learning opportunities. Accumulated data are so big and the relationships among the data are so complicated that it is difficult to grasp how closely the ULLs are related each other. Therefore, this paper proposes a system to help learners to grasp relationships among learners, knowledge, place and time, using network graphs and network analysis.", "authors": ["Kousuke Mouri", "Hiroaki Ogata", "Noriko Uosaki"], "session": "SESSION: Multilevel, multimodal and network analysis"}, {"title": "An exploratory study using social network analysis to model eye movements in mathematics problem solving", "pages": "383-387", "doi": "10.1145/2723576.2723591", "abstract": "Eye tracking is a useful tool to understand students' cognitive process during problem solving.

The study of common and consequential sequences of events (such as learners accessing resources, interacting with other learners and engaging in self-regulatory activities) and how these are associated with learning outcomes, as well as the ways in which knowledge and skills grow or evolve over time are both core areas of interest. Learning analytics datasets are replete with fine-grained temporal data: click streams; chat logs; document edit histories (e.g. wikis, etherpads); motion tracking (e.g. eye-tracking, Microsoft Kinect), and so on. However, the emerging area of temporal analysis presents both technical and theoretical challenges in appropriating suitable techniques and interpreting results in the context of learning.

Novice teachers especially need to understand the messages they are sending through nonverbal communication as this can have a major effect on their ability to manage behaviors and deliver content. Such learning should optimally occur before experiencing the real classroom. To assist in this process, we have developed a virtual classroom environment- TeachLivE- and used it for teacher practice, reflection and assessment. This paper investigates the way teachers use gestures in the virtual classroom settings of TeachLivE. Biology and algebra teachers were evaluated in our study. Analysis of video recordings from real and virtual environment seems to indicate that algebra teachers gesture significantly more often than biology teachers.
