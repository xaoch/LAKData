Dialogue in this middle space involves diverse stakeholders from multiple disciplines with various conceptions of the agency and nature of learning. We hold that a singularly unified field is not possible nor even desirable if we are to leverage the potential of this diversity, but progress is possible if we support \"productive multivocality\" between the diverse voices involved, facilitated by appropriate use of boundary objects.

The relationships between affect and learning outcomes have been previously studied, but not in a manner that is both longitudinal and finer-grained. Affect detectors are used to estimate student affective states based on post-hoc analysis of tutor log-data. For every student action in the tutor the detectors give us an estimated probability that the student is in a state of boredom, engaged concentration, confusion, and frustration, and estimates of the probability that they are exhibiting off-task or gaming behaviors. We ran the detectors on two years of log-data from 8th grade student use of the ASSISTments math tutoring system and collected corresponding end of year, high stakes, state math test scores for the 1,393 students in our cohort. By correlating these data sources, we find that boredom during problem solving is negatively correlated with performance, as expected; however, boredom is positively correlated with performance when exhibited during scaffolded tutoring. A similar pattern is unexpectedly seen for confusion.

To address this, we present a simple, scalable, and informative classification method that identifies a small number of longitudinal engagement trajectories in MOOCs. Learners are classified based on their patterns of interaction with video lectures and assessments, the primary features of most MOOCs to date. In an analysis of three computer science MOOCs, the classifier consistently identifies four prototypical trajectories of engagement. The most notable of these is the learners who stay engaged through the course without taking assessments. These trajectories are also a useful framework for the comparison of learner engagement between different course structures or instructional approaches. We compare learners in each trajectory and course across demographics, forum participation, video access, and reports of overall experience.

A description of the curriculum and the underlying pedagogical framework is followed by a discussion of the challenges to be tackled as part of this integration. We also include examples of data visualization based on real student and teacher data. With more than one million students and fifty thousand teachers using the curriculum, a massive and rich dataset is continuously updated. This repository depicts teacher and students usage of an inquiry-based science program, and offers exciting opportunities to leverage research to improve both teaching and learning. The growing dataset, with more than a hundred million items of activity in six months, also poses technical challenges such as data storage, complex aggregation and analysis with broader implications for pedagogy, big data, and learning.", "authors": ["Carlos Monroy", "Virginia Snodgrass Rangel", "Reid Whitaker"], "session": "SESSION: Supporting teachers"}, {"title": "Supporting action research with learning analytics", "pages": "220-229", "doi": "10.1145/2460296.2460340", "abstract": "Learning analytics tools should be useful, i.e., they should be usable and provide the functionality for reaching the goals attributed to learning analytics. This paper seeks to unite learning analytics and action research. Based on this, we investigate how the multitude of questions that arise during technology-enhanced teaching and learning systematically can be mapped to sets of indicators. We examine, which questions are not yet supported and propose concepts of indicators that have a high potential of positively influencing teachers' didactical considerations. Our investigation shows that many questions of teachers cannot be answered with currently available research tools. Furthermore, few learning analytics studies report about measuring impact.

In particular for Higher Education we describe how the Virtual World constructed using the platform Avaya Live Engage, is used as an immersive environment with pre-service teachers, who are undergoing a 1-year teacher training program, and how the data analytics collected in-world is being used to monitor and direct content development. We focus our studies on the initial hypothesis that 3D immersive environments are highly engaging and offer an experience that goes beyond the 'traditional' online education. We want to combine different analysis methods to be able to get empirical evidence showing the students' engagement with the 3D space in ways that can help us in the design of the learning experience accompanying the learners in their journey. In this paper we describe the research methods we use for the study, and give an overview of the information we can collect from the in-world analytics. We also propose how these analytics can be used for a predictive model with the intention of refocusing the virtual world experience to match learner needs.", "authors": ["Vanessa Camilleri", "Sara de Freitas", "Matthew Montebello", "Paul McDonagh-Smith"], "session": "SESSION: Supporting teachers"}, {"title": "Issues, challenges, and lessons learned when scaling up a learning analytics intervention", "pages": "235-239", "doi": "10.1145/2460296.2460343", "abstract": "This paper describes an intra-institutional partnership between a research team and a technology service group that was established to facilitate the scaling up of a learning analytics intervention.

A range of institutional policies exist which broadly set out the purposes for which data will be used and how data will be protected. The growing advent of learning analytics has seen the uses to which student data is put expanding rapidly. Generally though the policies setting out institutional use of student data have not kept pace with this change. Institutional policy frameworks should provide not only an enabling environment for the optimal and ethical harvesting and use of data, but also clarify: who benefits and under what conditions, establish conditions for consent and the de-identification of data, and address issues of vulnerability and harm. A directed content analysis of the policy frameworks of two large distance education institutions shows that current policy frameworks do not facilitate the provision of an enabling environment for learning analytics to fulfil its promise.", "authors": ["Paul Prinsloo", "Sharon Slade"], "session": "SESSION: Challenges"}, {"title": "Aggregating social and usage datasets for learning analytics: data-oriented challenges", "pages": "245-249", "doi": "10.1145/2460296.2460345", "abstract": "Recent work has studied real-life social and usage datasets from educational applications, highlighting the opportunity to combine or merge them. It is expected that being able to put together different datasets from various applications will make it possible to support learning analytics of a much larger scale and across different contexts. We examine how this can be achieved from a practical perspective by carrying out a study that focuses on three real datasets. More specifically, we combine social data that has been collected from the users of three learning portals and reflect on how they should be handled. We start by studying the data types and formats that these portals use to represent and store social and usage data. Then we develop crosswalks between the different schemas, so that merged versions of the source datasets may be created. The results of this bottom-up, hands-on investigation reveal several interesting issues that need to be overcome before aggregated sets of social and usage data can be actually used to support learning analytics research or services.", "authors": ["Katja Niemann", "Martin Wolpers", "Giannis Stoitsis", "Georgios Chinis", "Nikos Manouselis"], "session": "SESSION: Challenges"}, {"title": "From micro to macro: analyzing activity in the ROLE Sandbox", "pages": "250-254", "doi": "10.1145/2460296.2460347", "abstract": "Current learning services are increasingly based on standard Web technologies and concepts.

However, such standards are often focused on institutional and management perspectives or biased by their intended use. In this paper, we argue for Web logs as valuable data sources for learning analytics on all levels of Bronfenbrenner's Ecological System Theory and introduce a simple framework for Web log data enrichment, processing and further analysis.

Two game-inspired courses were developed at a high-enrollment public university in an effort to increase student engagement, and to provide students with more personalized learning experiences. We designed a learning management system, GradeCraft, to foreground the affordances of these grading systems, and to enhance the \"game-like\" experience for students. Along with serving as a translation layer for the grading systems of these courses, GradeCraft is also designed with an eye towards learning analytics, and captures information that can be described as student \"process\" data. Currently this data includes what types of assignments students choose to complete; how students assign percentage weights to their chosen assignments; how often and how accurately students check or model their course grades; and how successfully assignments are completed by students individually and the class as a whole across a structured grading rubric. We hope GradeCraft will give instructors new insight into student engagement, and provide data-driven ideas about how to tailor courses to student needs.", "authors": ["Caitlin Holman", "Stephen Aguilar", "Barry Fishman"], "session": "SESSION: Design briefings"}, {"title": "System for assessing classroom attention", "pages": "265-269", "doi": "10.1145/2460296.2460351", "abstract": "In this paper we give a preview of our system for automatically evaluating attention in the classroom.

Learning science must connect with learning pedagogy and design. Learners and institutions must have access to tools and resources that assist in customizing student progress and supplemental learning needs. Teachers and faculty must be empowered to provide teaching and learning environments that allow individual students to thrive. All this will require unique partnerships and collaborations within and across institutions, incorporating the best learning science findings and bridging with public and private entities developing the learning and analytic tools to support personalized learning.

Written discourse is arguably the primary class of data that can give us insights into deeper learning and higher order qualities such as critical thinking, argumentation, mastery of complex ideas, empathy, collaboration and interpersonal skills. Moreover, the ability to write in a scholarly manner is a core competence, often taking the form of discourse with oneself and the literature. Computational linguistics research has developed a rich array of tools for machine interpretation of human discourse, but work to develop these tools in the context of learning is at a relatively early stage. Moreover, there is a significant difference between designing tools to assist researchers in discourse analysis, and their deployment on platforms to provide meaningful analytics for the learners and educators who are conducting that discourse.
